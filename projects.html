      <span class="project-title">BERT-based models fine-tuning for Lithuanian language</span><br>
      Python, PyTorch, BERT models, NLTK<br>
      <small>Finetuned the base RoBERTa model for Lithuanian language. Based on this, trained and fine-tuned a BERT model for Named Entity Recognition
(NER) task to distinguish 8 different entities. Achieved outstanding token accuracy of 99.2% on the test data. Evaluated the model with broad
metrics like token precision, token recall, token F1-score, token entity exact precision, token entity exact recall, Matthews Coefficient, where each
metric achieved more than 91% of accuracy.</small>

      <span class="project-title">Malnutrition Risk Prediction</span><br>
      Python, Machine Learning, Scikit-Learn, Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistical methods<br>
      <small>Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a relatively high dataset from Kitchener-Waterloo hospital with 7845 observations and 1385
features. Engineered a missing values imputation strategy using Generative Neural Networks and standard ML algorithms, improving the accuracy from
60% to 92% with imputation strategy. Performed advanced feature selection using complex feature importance estimation pipeline, which identified the most impactful features, reducing
the dimensionality of features by 97% and preserving the most important information.</small>

      <span class="project-title">Parkinson's disease automated detection with Machine Learning</span><br>
      Python, Signal Processing, Time-Series Analysis, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow<br>
      <small>Performed advanced data analysis for signals time-series data with 116 channels, extracting from signals 10 different feature sets, identifying the
most important set by 10 cross-validation experiments with 10,000 bootstrapped repetitions. Achieved 87.5% accuracy for classification of patients diseased with Parkinsonâ€™s disease agains healthy group, the pipeline is now used by doctors
as a help for identification of diseases. Enhanced the prior existing solutions by more than 15% of accuracy, using a custom developed Deep Neural Network with Autoencoder.</small>
